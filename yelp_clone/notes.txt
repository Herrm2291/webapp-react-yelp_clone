My explanation of this code is as follows:

  renderSortByOptions() {
    return Object.keys(sortByOptions).map(sortByOption => {
      let sortByOptionValue = sortByOptions[sortByOption];
      return <li key={sortByOptionValue}>{sortByOption}</li>;
    });
  }

returnSortByOption is a function that does the following: Takes Object.keys and passes in the sortByOptions argument which is the variable I created above, then uses the .map function to iterate through the keys. A new variable sortByOptionValue is created which stores each of the sort options. Those sort options are then returned as list items, each with a key equal to the variable sortByOptionValue and that contains the sortByOption.
